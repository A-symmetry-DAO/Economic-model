## Introduction

The idealized vision of decentralized networks and socio-economic coordination triggered by the invention of Bitcoin continues to inspire entrepreneurs and drive innovation. Meanwhile, it is increasingly acknowledged within the crypto community that though the idealists are onto something, these emerging social systems are far from immune to problems that have plagued human institutions historically.
How to begin conceptualizing these networks and “decentralized autonomous organizations” (DAOs) in terms of resource distribution and power dynamics, and by extension, governance? One option is to think of these systems as fields. In what follows, I will give an overview of how this term is generally defined in sociology and how it could be operationalized when analyzing cryptonetworks.
Whether you’re an entrepreneur or engineer working on protocol design, an investor assessing opportunities, a policymaker considering regulation, or a researcher studying “crypto”, you may find this approach useful. Most importantly, a realistic analytical framework for thinking about power and resource distribution early on will hopefully assist in avoiding the threat of these emerging systems reproducing or even amplifying the various imbalances that characterize the economy as we know it today.
