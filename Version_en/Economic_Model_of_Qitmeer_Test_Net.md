# Economic Model of Qitmeer Test Net

##  Definition

- HalalChain ERC20 token：HLC
- Qitmeer test net token：p-meer
-  Native token of Qitmeer network：Meer 

## Summary

Economic Model of Qitmeer Test Net is a transitional scheme to the main network. On the one hand, at this period, we will introduce real miners' hashrate to test the Qitmeer network. On the other hand, we will complete the transition and mapping from HLC token (also and p-meer) to Qitmeer main network.

During test network, one p-meer minted by miners, correspondingly, one HLC token burnt. The total number of p-meer and HLC remained at 1 billion. The number of p-meer which can be minted will be directly related to the number of HLC token which are burnt. At the end of the test network, the dual-channel mapping of HLC --> Meer and p-meer --> Meer will be established.


## Current Structure of HLC token

HLC token have been allocated via ICO, mainly in the following parts: the market part sold by ICO, development fund and development team award.

- the market part: personal assets that have confirmed ownership,assuming A.

- the development fund: public assets of the chain which will be used for ecological development,assuming B.

- the team award: personal assets that haven’t allocated,assuming C.

The exact number of A, B and C will be announced by HLC foundation, A+B+C=1 billion.
